I'm a computational linguist, graduating from my PhD at UC Berkeley advised by [Terry Regier](https://lclab.berkeley.edu/regier). My dissertation evaluates what neural networks learn about phonology, morphosyntax and semantics across more than 80 languages. I am a Senior Data Science Fellow at [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu), where I consult and teach on natural language processing and data science with Python. I am a researcher in the [Measuring Hate Speech](https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu) team, where we develop NLP methods to identify hate speech and abusive language online. I built the [Cerberus app](https://github.com/geoffbacon/cerberus) to reduce the annotation burden of linguists. This summer, I am a researcher at the [International Computer Science Institute](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu), working on integrating structured lexical resources with learned semantic representations.

Before my PhD, I was a project manager at [Kleffmann Group](https://www.kleffmann.com/en) and taught English in [Grosseto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosseto) and [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris). I studied lingiustics, classics and Arabic at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au). As a language learner, I’ve studied French, Italian, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Middle Egyptian. As a linguist, I’ve worked on [Somali](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/soma1255), [Nafsan](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sout2856) and [Tswefap](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/bato1245), and spent two months in [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilorin) conducting fieldwork on [CiShigini](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tsis1238).
