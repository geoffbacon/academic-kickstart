My research evaluates what neural networks learn about language, through computational experiments, massively cross-linguistic datasets and fine-grained error analysis. In my dissertation, I build and analyze large datasets in more than 80 languages to characterize the phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic knowledge of neural networks. I seek to understand where and how existing models fail, in order to help develop more human-like models of language.
