Through [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu), I offer [free consulting](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consultation/geoff-bacon-0) on Natural Language Processing and Python to UC Berkeley's community. Broadly, if you're working on a project involving natural language data (text or speech), I'm happy to help. Common topics include: 

- Building and preprocessing NLP datasets
- Data quality metrics
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Syntactic parsing
- Named entity recognition
- Text classification
- Information extraction
- Consuming web APIs
- Web scraping

I have a special focus on applying these techniques to languages other than English or [Standard Average European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European).

For Python projects, I can help with:

- Reproducible workflows (git, GitHub, Docker)
- Data engineering
- Data analysis (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scientific Python ecosystem (scipy, jupyter)
- Machine learning (scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Squashing bugs
